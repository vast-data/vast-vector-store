# Deferred Work

## Deferred from: code review of story 1-1-initialize-package-scaffold-with-uv-and-hatchling (2026-04-09)

- `langchain-tests` dev dependency is unpinned — risk of breaking changes from upstream. Consider pinning to a range like `langchain-tests>=1.1,<2` before running integration tests (Story 3.1).
- sdist build has no exclude configuration — `_bmad/`, `_bmad-output/`, `docs/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `.cursor/`, `.opencode/` would be included in a source distribution. Add `[tool.hatch.build.targets.sdist]` exclude before PyPI publication (Story 4.3).
- `langchain-core>=0.3` allows a wide version range spanning 0.x to 1.x. The lockfile resolves 1.2.28. Consider tightening to `>=1.0,<2` when Epic 2 implements real VectorStore methods.
- `readme = "README.md"` currently points at GitLab boilerplate containing the internal corporate URL `https://git.vastdata.com/genai/vast-vector-store.git`. Story 4.1 will rewrite the README — ensure internal URLs are removed before publication.
- No `py.typed` marker file (PEP 561) — type checkers will ignore inline annotations. Add `src/langchain_vastdb/py.typed` when Epic 2 introduces typed method signatures.
